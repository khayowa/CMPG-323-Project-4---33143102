IT Development Semester Project 4

## Project Description
The objective to this project is to implement <strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong> <i>(RPA)</i> for user acceptance testing <i>(UAT)</i>.Robotic Process Automation is the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the same way that a person would execute a process. UAT is where a team of ‘testers’ would have a test dataset containing input data and desired output data. The testers would then insert each record of input data into each field of the web application and test that the desired output is generated. 

### Task
The task is to use an Excel file with test data on an app hosted on azure cloud. This task will be executed by RPA.

## RPA Specification
The Robotic Process Automation product used is UiPath. There are a range of products available like Automation Anywhere or Microsoft but the choice was to go with the Leader and Star Performer UiPath. The solution to the given task will be constructed on UiPath Studio Community Edition.
